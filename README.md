# OpenGL 3D Rendering

An exploration of 3D rendering in OpenGL by `Nokota Mustang`.

Computer graphics is a vast field, and I am interested in learning more about the rendering process and the mathematics behind it. Having a good grasp of realtime graphics, data structures, and algorithms is essential for game development, simulations, and visualizations. I've completed 2D game projects before, but I want to learn more about 3D graphics and rendering.

There is a lot of crossover to modern App development, and the skills learned here can be applied to AR/VR, simulations, and data visualization. In addition data processing and machine learning can benefit from the parallel processing capabilities of the GPU; so learning about graphics rendering is a good investment of time.

Opengl is a low-level graphics API that can be used to create 3D graphics, but it is quite complex and requires a lot of boilerplate code to get started.

There are several very detailed books about graphics rendering, but when it comes to creating real-time graphics with interactive applications, there is a complex balance between performance and quality. This means there are several ideas and solutions to some of the same problems, but the issue becomes how to combine multiple techniques to create a coherent and efficient system.

When exploring a game engine the low level rendering process is abstracted away, and an assortment of tools and features are provided, which also sometimes carries code-bloat and performance overhead. The bigger the engine, the more features and tools are available, but the more complex and harder to learn it becomes; such in the case of 'Unity' or 'Unreal Engine'.

Therefore to learn how to approach graphics from a first-principles perspective, I will be exploring Python and C++ based languages.

`ModernGL and Pygame 3D demonstrations`

Each project is a standalone example of a 3D rendering technique or feature working with Python 3.12. Some projects are combined to create a more complex scene. Each project is a self-contained example that can be run independently. ModernGL is a Python wrapper around OpenGL that simplifies the process of creating 3D graphics.

ModernGL wraps OpenGL in Python and simplifies the process of creating 3D graphics by grouping tedious API calls into simpler logical routines. Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries designed to be used with the Python programming language. This makes a perfect pair of libraries to create 3D graphics in Python. I will build a series of examples using ModernGL and Pygame to explore 3D rendering techniques, and eventually combine them to create a 3D game engine.

## 1.a brdf blinn-phong - Blinn-Phong

A _bidirectional reflectance distribution function_ is a function of four real variables that defines how light from a source is reflected off an opaque surface. As I understand it, _Physically Based Rendering_ (PBR) arrived much later and focuses more on realistic physical properties, rather than a more artistic approach from Blinn-Phong. Blinn's model is an approximate of Phong shading, which was often commented to look like 'plastic'.

This example creates a 3D mesh from scratch and applying a BRDF shader program to render the illumination model described by the _Blinn-Phong_ model from 1975.

The physical model simulates the way light interacts with materials. This includes models for diffuse reflection, specular reflection, and transmission. These models are based on the physical properties of materials, such as their reflectance, roughness, and index of refraction.

Therefore, in Blinn-Phong, each material has a set of properties that include the albedo, roughness, and metallic value. The albedo is the base color of the material, the roughness is how rough or smooth the material is, the metallic is how metallic or non-metallic the material is, and the normal map is a texture that simulates surface detail.

Because we communicate with the GPU using OpenGL under the hood, we need to send data to the GPU in the form of buffers. We create a Vertex Buffer Object (VBO) to store the vertices, and an Element Buffer Object (EBO) to store the indices of the vertices that make up the triangles of the cube.

The shader program is a combination of a vertex shader and a fragment shader. The vertex shader is responsible for transforming the vertices of the cube into screen space, and the fragment shader is responsible for calculating the color of each pixel on the cube. These shaders are written in GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) and operate in parallel on the GPU via thousands shader cores.

Therefore learning to write code in parallel is essential for creating efficient graphics applications.

## 1.b ssaa - Super sampling anti-aliasing

I added anti-aliasing with a sized up render buffer with 4 samples. This is considered to be 'SSAA' or 'Super-Sample Anti-Aliasing', and usually run slower than other methods but produces the best quality.

Without anti-aliasing, the edges of the cube appear jagged because the pixels on the screen are square and the edges of the cube are not aligned with the pixels. Anti-aliasing smooths out the edges of the cube by blending the colors of the pixels along the edges.

![Screenshots](./screenshots/mgl_ssaa1.png)

The basic principle of SSAA is to render the scene at a higher resolution and then down-sample it to the screen resolution. In MGL this is done by rendering the scene to a render buffer with a higher resolution than the screen, and then down-sampling it to the screen resolution using a **blit** from the render buffer to the screen buffer.

Other multiple anti-aliasing techniques exist, and they all have trade-offs between quality and performance. The most common anti-aliasing techniques are MSAA (Multi-Sample Anti-Aliasing), FXAA (Fast Approximate Anti-Aliasing), and TAA (Temporal Anti-Aliasing).

MSAA is a cheaper form of SSAA. Instead of going through the process of sampling every pixel, MSAA only comes into play where aliasing could become an issue such as an edge, which saves a lot of computing resources.

FXAA is a post-processing anti-aliasing technique that is applied to the final image. It is a fast and efficient way to smooth out the edges of the cube, but it can produce artifacts and blur the image.

TAA is a temporal anti-aliasing technique that uses information from previous frames to smooth out the edges by blending pixel information. It is considered to produce average results with a lot of blurring, but computationally cheaper than other methods.

## 2.a texture - texture map

This example adds more cubes to the scene and applies a texture to each cube. The texture is a 2D image that is mapped to the surface of the cube using texture coordinates. The texture coordinates are stored in the VBO along with the vertices of the cube.

![Screenshots](./screenshots/mgl_texture1.png)

With basic illumination applied in addition to the texture the scene is starting to look more realistic. The floor is a grid of cubes to illustrate how to create a large scene with many objects. However, this is usually considered inefficient because each cube is a separate draw call to the GPU; whereas for a floor only the top faces of the cubes are visible. More on this later.

## 2.b shadow - shadow map

A shadow map casting system is added to the cubes demo; this example also re-uses shaders and therefore shader program values are set for each object before rendering.

![Screenshots](./screenshots/mgl_shadow1.png)
_Note the cubes are floating, not sitting on the ground._

A two pass rendering system is used to create shadows in the scene. The first pass renders the scene from the perspective of the light source to create a shadow map. The second pass renders the scene from the perspective of the camera and uses the shadow map to determine if a pixel is in shadow or not. This is a standard approach to rending shadows: <https://www.opengl-tutorial.org/intermediate-tutorials/tutorial-16-shadow-mapping/>.

A shadow map is a depth buffer that is rendered from the perspective of the light source. The depth buffer is then used to determine if a pixel on the cube is in shadow or not. If the pixel is in shadow, it is darkened; if it is not in shadow, it is illuminated.

OpenGL is efficient and has some tools that compute some of these factors on the GPU, and we can use the shader program to calculate the state of a pixel, whether it is in shadow or not.

In an ideal situation, we would send all data in matrices to the shader, and then render all objects in one go with minimal value changes to the shader program.

The caveat of this approach is a shadow map is needed per light source that you want to model. I create a global light (the sun) with a shadow map for it and I create a second shadow map for a flash light positioned from the camera. Press `f` to toggle this light source. Press `f2` to toggle the global light source.

I created a debug view that shows the lights in a really weird way, press `f4` to toggle, and the `mouse wheel` will add or remove ambient lighting to the scene.

## 3.a cook-torrance - Cook-Torrance

In 1982, Robert Cook and Kenneth Torrance published a reflectance model that is claimed to more accurately represent the physical reality of light compared to others such as the Blinn-Phong model.

![Screenshots](./screenshots/mgl_cook1.png)

For more realism, the computation of the BRDF is more complex.

## 4.a grass - Grass rendering

As we have explored shader programs and how they can be used to render 3D objects, we can use them to render more complex objects such as grass. Grass in complex scenes isn't modelled from a 3D mesh, but rather a series of 2D planes called 'billboards'.

![Screenshots](./screenshots/mgl_grass1.png)

Starting from the tutorial: <https://vulpinii.github.io/tutorials/grass-modelisation/en/> and <https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems/part-i-natural-effects/chapter-7-rendering-countless-blades-waving-grass>.

This is a common technique in games to render large amounts of grass efficiently, since we can send a vector of points to what is called a 'geometry shader', and this in turn can create all the billboards around each point, then passed to the fragment shader to render hte grass texture on the billboards.

Commonly, billboards are rotated to always face the camera. This is an effective trick to make the grass appear 3D, even though they are 2D.

Part of the amazing quality of parallel processing on the GPU is that we can simulate wind movement on the grass using a 'flow map'. This is a 2D texture that is used to simulate the movement of the grass in the wind. The flow map is used to offset the position of the grass in the geometry shader, and this creates the effect of the grass moving in the wind.

Some more info on flow maps: <https://github.com/JaccomoLorenz/godot-flow-map-shader>

## 4.b grass_2 - Grass rendering from a texture atlas

Expanding on the grass rendering to use a texture atlas for the grass rendering. This is a more efficient way to store multiple textures in a single texture.

![Screenshots](./screenshots/mgl_grass2.png)

A texture atlas is a single texture that contains multiple textures. This is useful for rendering multiple objects with different textures in a single draw call. In this example, we use a texture atlas to store multiple grass textures in a 4x4 grid, and then use a shader program to select the correct texture for each grass blade.

In this example, the indexing is manually stated in the geom shader. However in a more complex scene, we would map the texture locations for each grass blade, and then use the texture to select the correct texture in the shader program. More on this later.

## 5.a ground - Ground rendering

I create a simple ground plane from a mathematical function, to form a grid of vertices which are divided into quads; and then two triangles per quad for texturing. The texture is a 2D image that is mapped to the surface of the ground plane using texture coordinates. The texture coordinates are stored in the VBO along with the vertices of the ground plane.

![Screenshots](./screenshots/mgl_ground1.png)

This, mentally, isn't far more complex than the cube example, but we need to understand how to create a large area efficiently and produce the relationship between the vertices and the pairs of triangles forming the ground plane.

## 5.b ground_2 - Height map

Rendering a simple ground plane with a texture and a height map from an image.

![Screenshots](./screenshots/mgl_ground2.png)

In practice, the height map could be procedurally generated or loaded from an image file. The height map is used to displace the vertices of the ground plane in the vertex shader, and this creates the effect of a 3D ground plane.

## 5.c ground_3 - Ground and grass rendering

I've combined several techniques to render the ground plane with a height map, and calculating normals for lighting. I added a global lighting model, and adding our local lights to the scene; and added a skybox.

![Screenshots](./screenshots/mgl_ground3.png)

This is a complex example that combines several techniques to render a realistic scene. The ground plane is created from a height map and displaced in the vertex shader. The normals of the ground plane are calculated in the geometry shader and passed to the fragment shader for lighting calculations.

The grass is created along each point on the ground plane using a geometry shader and a flow map to simulate wind movement. The grass fills the triangles, for now, but in a more complex scene later on I will create an interactive tool to paint the grass on the ground plane, by selecting the points and texture on the atlas to use.

In the case of large scenes, we need to use a 'chunk' system to load and unload parts of the scene as the camera moves around. This is because loading the entire scene into memory at once would be inefficient and slow. More on this later.

## 5.d ground_4 - Chunk dynamic loading and generated flora

<!-- Obviously the ground_3 demo is slow when set with a very large terrain mech, so I've added a chunk system to load and unload parts of the height map as the camera moves around.

In this example, the height map is divided into chunks, and only the chunks that are visible to the camera are loaded into memory. This is done by calculating the distance from the camera to each chunk, and then loading and unloading the chunks based on the distance.

I've also integrated the texture atlas for the grass rendering, and added procedural generation of the flora on the ground plane. -->
